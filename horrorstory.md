      Part 1:
      This is it. The house. The old mansion on the hill that had been the center of all sorts of chilling stories told by the neighbourhood children. Some said that it was haunted and most people who ventured in never lived to tell the tale. Others claimed that an old eccentric hermit resided in the dark basement and consumed the blood and flesh of homosapiens to stay alive. All the unsubstantiated claims had fanned the flames of my interest. Therefore, I mustered up my courage and ventured into the mansion alone, armed with a camcorder equipped with night vision.
      If only I knew what I was about to encounter. If only I knew.
      Other than slight slivers of moonlight streaming through the tiny cracks in the wooden window slats, I only had the illuminated screen of my camcorder to guide me around. The old wooden floorboards creaked along with each step I took, pointing my camcorder around. Graffiti adorned the walls filled with cracks and the furniture was coated with a layer of dirt, dust and cobwebs. Liquid was dripping from the ceiling and the wet floor was covered with dark puddles and shoe prints.
      Creak...
      I spun around, startled by the noise. I looked at the screen of my camcorder.
      Nothing.
      Perhaps it was just a rat. Nonetheless. it did put me on edge. I could sense that the atmosphere at somehow changed. By then, my heart was palpitating. My stomach, twisted in knots and my hair standing at its end.
      I wanted out.
      I retraced my steps back to the main door. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a flash of black, darting from one side of the room to the other. My lips quivered and my eyes were wild with fear. I pointed my camcorder in the direction where I had seen the silhouette. A strangled scream escaped my throat as I looked at the screen and identified the towering figure of a creature staring straight at me. Those death-like eyes, devoid of all emotions. If it were not for its heaving chest, I would have mistaken it for a statue. Wild with fear, my scream pierced the air as I bolted away from the figure, promptly dropping the camcorder in my wake.
     Driven by fear, I raced blindy as my heart pounded at an alarming speed. Alas, in my frenzy, I ran into a corridor with a dead end rather than an exit. Knowing that the creature was still hot on my heels, I scurried into a room on the right. I managed to find an old wardrobe and scampered in.
     Peeking through the cracks of the old wardrobe, my eyes were glued onto the silhouette as it surveyed the room like a bloodhound trying to pick up my scent. I stifled a whimper as it paced around the room, past my hiding spot.
      I felt the tension dissipate from my body as the creature left the room. The danger was not totally over yet, but at least, my life at that point of time was spared.
      With the creature out of sight, I quietly crawled out of the wardrobe. I slowly crept over to the window and looked out.
      The main road!
      Still shaking from the adrenaline rush of being chased by an unknown creature, I grabbed the bottom rail of the window and forcefully pushed it upwards. Thankfully, Lady Luck was on my side and the window rattled open. Climbing out, I made a run for the main road, not turning around for a fraction of a second until I was in a brightly lit area.
      The next day, I spent most of my time in school rationalising what I might have encountered. Perhaps it was indeed a hermit living in the house and I had alarmed him with my intrusion. However, I knew for sure from his malicious gait, that he was way more than that. It was indeed a pity that I left my camcorder behind.
       Later that afternoon, when I got home, I saw an unmarked brown box on the ground of my front door. I opened it up.
       It was my camcorder.
       Upon switching it on, what I saw, scared the living daylights out of me. I could feel a giant lump, as big as a golf ball, forming in my throat. A cocktail of shock, confusion and fear simmered within me. My scalp began to prickle, fear momentarily incapacitated me. I felt the world around me spin as a struggled to regain my focus. 
       Just then, darkness ensued. The world around me went black.
       Part 2:
       My eyelids fluttered open like a pair of frail butterflies taking flight. Disoriented, I could make out blurred figures all huddled around me. The unfamiliar still of antiseptic pricked my nostrils as I struggled to sit upright.
       I was at the hospital.
       "OH MY GOODNESS ANGELA THANK GOD YOU ARE FINALLY AWAKE! Aaron! Get the nurse!" My mother exclaimed, tears welled up in her eyes and a look of relief was clearly etched on her face.
       "Wha... what happened? Why am I here?" I muttered.
